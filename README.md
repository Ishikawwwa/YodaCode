## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **GigaChat API Access**: You need a GigaChat Client Secret Key to use this extension
   - Visit [Sber Developer Portal](https://developers.sber.ru/studio) to register and get your Client Secret Key
   - Make sure to copy the Base64 encoded value of the Client Secret Key
   - The extension uses the `gigachat-node` library for API communication

### Install from Source

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the project in VS Code
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Compile the extension:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```
5. Press `F5` to launch a new Extension Development Host with the extension loaded

## Configuration

### Required Settings

1. **Open VS Code Settings** (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`)
2. Search for "Yoda"
3. Configure the following settings:

#### GigaChat Client Secret Key
```json
{
  "yoda.gigachat.apiKey": "your-gigachat-client-secret-key-in-base64-here"
}
```

**Important**: The API key should be your GigaChat Client Secret Key in Base64 format. You can get this key from the [Sber Developer Portal](https://developers.sber.ru/studio). Make sure to copy the Base64 encoded value.

### Optional Settings

#### Auto Analysis
```json
{
  "yoda.autoAnalyze": true  // Analyze files automatically on save
}
```

#### Custom Best Practices
```json
{
  "yoda.bestPractices": {
    "general": [
      "Use meaningful variable and function names",
      "Keep functions small and focused",
      "Add proper error handling"
    ],
    "javascript": [
      "Use const/let instead of var",
      "Prefer arrow functions for callbacks"
    ],
    "typescript": [
      "Define proper types for all variables",
      "Avoid 'any' type unless necessary"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Default Severity
```json
{
  "yoda.severity": "warning"  // "error", "warning", or "info"
}
```

## Usage

### Commands

The extension provides several commands accessible via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`):

- **Yoda: Analyze Current File** - Analyzes the currently open file
- **Yoda: Analyze All Files** - Analyzes all supported files in the workspace
- **Yoda: Configure Best Practices** - Opens settings for customizing best practices

### Context Menu

Right-click on any supported file in the Explorer or Editor to access:
- **Yoda: Analyze Current File**

### Automatic Analysis

When `yoda.autoAnalyze` is enabled (default), Yoda automatically analyzes files when you save them.

### Status Bar

The status bar shows Yoda's current state:
- `‚úì Yoda Ready` - Extension is ready to analyze code
- `‚Üª Yoda Analyzing...` - Currently analyzing code
- `‚úì Yoda: X issues found` - Analysis complete (shown temporarily)
- `‚úó Yoda Error` - Error occurred (check the output panel)

## Supported Languages

**Primary Focus:**
- üêç **Python (`.py`)** - Full PEP 8 analysis, type hints, Pythonic patterns

**Also Supported:**
- JavaScript (`.js`)
- TypeScript (`.ts`)
- Java (`.java`)
- C# (`.cs`)
- C++ (`.cpp`, `.c`)

## What Yoda Checks in Python Code

### PEP 8 Compliance
- ‚úÖ Naming conventions (snake_case, PascalCase)
- ‚úÖ Line length (88 characters with Black formatter)
- ‚úÖ Import organization and formatting
- ‚úÖ Whitespace and indentation

### Modern Python Practices
- ‚úÖ Type hints for parameters and return values
- ‚úÖ F-string usage instead of old formatting
- ‚úÖ List/dict comprehensions where appropriate
- ‚úÖ Context managers (`with` statements)
- ‚úÖ Proper exception handling with specific types
- ‚úÖ Dataclasses for data structures

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ Proper docstrings (Google/NumPy style)
- ‚úÖ Logging instead of print statements
- ‚úÖ Meaningful variable names
- ‚úÖ Function size and complexity
- ‚úÖ Avoiding mutable default arguments

## Best Practices Configuration

Yoda comes with built-in best practices for different languages, but you can customize them to match your company's coding standards:

### Adding Custom Rules

1. Open VS Code Settings
2. Search for "yoda.bestPractices"
3. Edit the JSON object to add your rules:

```json
{
  "yoda.bestPractices": {
    "general": [
      "Your general coding rule here"
    ],
    "javascript": [
      "JavaScript-specific rule here"
    ],
    "python": [
      "Python-specific rule here"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Language-Specific Rules

Each language can have its own set of best practices. The extension will combine general rules with language-specific rules when analyzing code.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Extension not analyzing code**
   - Check that your GigaChat Client Secret Key is configured correctly and is in Base64 format
   - Ensure the file language is supported
   - Check the VS Code output panel for error messages

2. **"GigaChat API key not configured" warning**
   - Set your Client Secret Key (Base64) in settings: `yoda.gigachat.apiKey`

3. **Analysis takes too long**
   - Large files may take longer to analyze
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify GigaChat API is accessible

### Output Panel

For detailed logs and error messages, check the Output panel:
1. Open View ‚Üí Output
2. Select "Yoda Code Mentor" from the dropdown
